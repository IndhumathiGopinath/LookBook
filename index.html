        2025 is the year I’ll crush my goals—unless 
        it’s my Wi-Fi crashing again. <br>
        I’ll rise like my phone’s battery 
        after an overnight charge, unstoppable, 
        and full of 100% vibes. <br>
        This year, I’ll be as productive as a 
        cat on a keyboard and as fearless as someone who hits 
        'Reply All' with confidence. <br>
        Cheers to a year of laughter, wins, 
        and pretending I know what I’m doing! <br>
        🚀😄 Your ability to stay calm and composed in challenging situations, whether it's managing your academics or handling the pressures of dual degrees, is truly admirable.
